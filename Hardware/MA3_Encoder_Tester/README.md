# Tester for US Digital MA3 encoders

This is an Arduino-based encoder tester that uses a 2.4" LCD touch screen to display encoder values - current. max, and min
with a textual display of the current voltage and a bar showing the relative voltage at the bottom of the display.

Yes, this is total overkill but it's cooler than just using a voltmeter and a power supply.
